# Vugu/Todo/Async Demo

This repo contains code which demonstrates a simple Todo application which uses
Go on Frontend (FE) and Backend (BE). The FE is built using vugu and the BE uses
AWS services.

This repo contains the following three directories:
- `backend` which contains the logic for the backend services
- `frontend` which contains the logic for the browser application and a devserver to
  serve it
- `models` a directory which contains the Todo data model which is common to the
  FE and the BE

# Building the application

Follow the instructions inside the `backend` directory to build and deploy the
backend on AWS; then follow the instructions in `frontend` to build the frontend
and serve it locally.
